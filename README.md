# Writing Room

[Visit live page here](https://renatabiniek.github.io/writing-room/)

## Introduction & Site Purpose
---
### Welcome to the Writing Room!

![Responsive Writing Room Site](docs/responsive-site.webp)

As a writer, an expat and a gay woman relocating from hectic East London to suburban Dublin on a quest for a slower, more mindful life, I have a first-hand understanding of the importance of a welcoming community who share the same interests. 
 
[Writing Room](https://renatabiniek.github.io/writing-room/) is a website for a creative writing and mindfulness group in Malahide and other towns in North County Dublin, Ireland. Its main purpose is to create an inclusive, safe and meaningful space (physical and online) for writers to write, develop and connect by sharing their stories. It hopes to promote creativity and mindfulness by organising regular topic specific events, workshops and meetups. 

The target audience are new and established writers of all backgrounds and nationalities who are looking to write regularly, grow and socialise together, and are based in the north areas of Dublin.

Writing Room site will be useful for local creatives as a platform to connect with like-minded people. Interested writers will be able to easily learn what local writing and mindfulness events are coming up and how they can join them. Geographical proximity of the event locations eliminates the long commute to Dublin city centre which might motivate any hesitant writers to meet and write regularly which will help them to achieve their creative goals.

## User Experience (UX)
---
### Project goals

* to provide a platform for creative adult community living in North County Dublin to connect and participate in a variety of events
* to promote creative writing and encourage regular writing routine by organising writing workshops and meetups
* to evoke interest in mindfulness and its benefits for creativity

### User Goals
* to have access to writing and mindfulness events that take place locally and can be attended regularly without long commute to the city center
* to find clear information on the group purpose, location and signing up process
* to learn more about mindfulness and the creative process
* to join the group by signing up for a selected event

### Site Owner’s Goals:
* to create online presence for the writing and mindfulness group in North County Dublin, Ireland
* to promote creative writing by organising writing events
* to gain new group members and create a community of like-minded people 

### Target audience for this website is:

* adult writers at any skill level and of all backgrounds 
* living in and around Malahide, Portmarnock, Kinsealy, Skerries and Swords, North County Dublin
* writers new to Dublin
* writers looking to get motivated to write regularly
* creative adults looking to connect and socialise within a like-minded community
* creative adults looking to slow down and introduce mindfulness into their creative process

### Research: 

While researching writing and creative groups in the area, I found that the majority of them are based in central Dublin. Long commutes can demotivate and discourage attending workshops and writing events regularly, alienating writers living in suburbia from the writing community. The very few groups in north parts of Dublin are either closed for new members or provide very limited group information and don’t have a dedicated website.  This project fills the gap by providing a clear and accessible platform to encourage creativity, mindfulness and foster a sense of a community for writers in a suburban area of Dublin.

### Business goals:

This site is based on the B2C model although the visit doesn’t finish with an actual purchase as all the events are free to join. It satisfies emotional triggers of the visitors to this site, provides them with clear and easily accessible information on the subject, and guides them to join the group by submitting the sign up form. It stands out as other writing groups have either no online presence or their websites have poor UX, or overcomplicated design and content overload.

### **User stories:**

### Structure:

The site has a simple layout of 2 pages with the home page containing the highest priority information, and the second page providing an option of further reading on mindful writing for interested visitors, without distracting them from the main content on the home page. 

Navigation elements are conventionally placed in a horizontal fashion at the top of the browser window. On their visit, the user lands on a page with an eye-catching hero image which includes a compelling slogan and a call to action button that encourages them to join the group. From here, the user can immediately tell if the group is of interest to them, as it conveys the purpose of the meetups and their location.

Further information is progressively disclosed as the user scrolls down through the page. The group ethos section allows the user to learn more about the group’s setup and benefits. Next, they are introduced to a short text on mindful writing with an option to read more by clicking on a hyperlink to the second page. They can either click it and once done, come back to the home page  or continue scrolling through the main page and visit the second page later by clicking the Mindful Pages section in the navbar. Next on the homepage, the user is taken to the events schedule where they can view all scheduled events at one glance. A join us button allows them to skip the rest of the content and go to the signup form immediately. Otherwise, the user continues to scroll down through the page to find a gallery to see what past events looked like and get reassured in joining the community. 

This is followed by a location page with a map,  a contact form and a footer with social media links and an option to sign up for a newsletter. From there, the user also can return to the top of the page by clicking the back-to-top button.
 
Links to events and contact pages are also presented in the navbar, to allow returning visitors to quickly access the information that will be of most relevance to them. 

For consistency of user experience, the site logo, navigation links and footer are repeated on the 2nd page. The second page contains a larger block of text accompanied by a decorative image and an option to go to events schedule. The user has an option to navigate back to the home page or go to the contact form as well via navbar links.

### Wireframes:

Low fidelity mock-ups were made using Balsamiq to help plan and visualise the navigation design, placement of information, features, relationship between the content and usefulness. They were created for 3 main screen sizes: mobile, tablet and desktop.

* [Wireframes - Morning Pages](docs/morning-pages.pdf)


### Design:  
<br>

* **Colour scheme**
    
    The colour pallete consists of calm, subdued colors that compliment each other and evoke mindful mood throught the site. 
    
    Majority of them was derived from the hero image colours using [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) and the remaing colours were added to the scheme using the colour scheme generator [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). White was used for text on buttons, for best contrast.  

    ![Colours](docs/colour-scheme.jpg)

    opal: #c5e0d8ff

    blue-sapphire: #186577ff 

    silver: #c9c9c9ff 

    old-lavender: #846577ff 

    gunmetal: #2a2d32ff 

    Apart from the above, white was used for text on buttons for best contrast.  
    <br>

* **Typography**

    The fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

    **Courgette, cursive**
    Used for logo and headings, with cursive as a fallback font in case the original font family isn't imported correctly for some reason.
    I've chosen this font as it's imitating handwriting which supports the goal of the Writing Room group, focusing on creative writing and writing by hand. 

    **Montserrat, sans-serif**
    Main font for the body. This is a clean, popular and very readable font that I chose to contrast with the more decorative style of the logo and headings.
    Sans-serif is the fallback option.  
<br> 

* **Imagery**

    All images were sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
    
    Large minimalistic image of a desk with typewriter and notebook was chosen for the hero image to serve as an illustration to the group purpose and serve as a clean background forthe slogan and location information.

    Other images are used either as a decoration accompanying larger blocks of text to provide a balanced content and ensure user is not overloaded with text, or as the actual site content (gallery).
