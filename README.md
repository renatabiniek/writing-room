##Introduction & Purpose of this site

**Welcome to the Writing Room!**

As a writer, an expat and a gay women relocating from hectic East London to suburban Dublin on a quest for a slower, more mindful life, I have a first-hand understanding of the importance of a welcoming community who share the same interests. 
 
[Writing Room](https://) is a website for a creative writing and mindfulness group in Malahide and other towns in North County Dublin, Ireland. Its main purpose is to create an inclusive, safe and meaningful space (physical and online) for writers to write, develop and connect by sharing their stories. It hopes to promote creativity and mindfulness by organising regular topic specific events, workshops and meetups. 

The target audience are new and established writers of all backgrounds and nationalities who are looking to write regularly, grow and socialise together, and are based in the north areas of Dublin.

[Writing Room](https://) site will be useful for local creatives as a platform to connect with like-minded people. Interested writers will be able to easily learn what local writing and mindfulness events are coming up and how they can join them. Geographical proximity of the event locations eliminates the long commute to Dublin city centre which might motivate any hesitant writers to meet and write regularly which will help them to achieve their creative goals.
