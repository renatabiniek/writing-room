                    As a procrastinating writer, an expat and a gay women who relocated from hectic East London to
                    suburban Dublin on a quest for a slower, more mindful life,
                    I know how important it is to find a welcoming community who share the same interests.

                    Writing Room has been setup to create an inclusive, safe and meaningful space (physical and
                    online)
                    for writers to write, develop and connect by sharing their stories. We are all about writing and
                    slowing down, so we write longhand and explore mindfulness techniques to reconnect with
                    ourselves
                    and the present moment.

                    Come and join us for one of our popular events - all you need is a pen and a notebook, no
                    writing or
                    mindfulness experience is necessary!

        <h2>Mindful writing</h2>

            <div id="mindful-text">
                <p><q>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re
                        doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us</q>, says Jon
                    Kabat-Zinn, pioneer of mindfulness-based stress reduction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Research demonstrates that mindfulness improves a person’s ability to concentrate, decreases the fear
                    of being judged and enhances open-minded thinking while reducing aversive self-conscious thinking.
                    These points map directly onto key characteristics of creative habits of working, thinking, and
                    being in the world.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Mindful writing enables us to reconnect with the essence of the writing process, and both can be
                    very therapeutic. Using simple meditation and writing exercises, you can learn how to find stillness
                    in your mind, move through creative blocks caused by over-thinking or self-criticism. This involves
                    stripping away the layers of “noise” that cloud your view of the world—things like
                    fear, anxiety, and rambling thoughts. As you get rid of these obstructions, you will start to see
                    the world more clearly, the goal of every writer.
