                    As a procrastinating writer, an expat and a gay women who relocated from hectic East London to
                    suburban Dublin on a quest for a slower, more mindful life,
                    I know how important it is to find a welcoming community who share the same interests.

                    Writing Room has been setup to create an inclusive, safe and meaningful space (physical and
                    online)
                    for writers to write, develop and connect by sharing their stories. We are all about writing and
                    slowing down, so we write longhand and explore mindfulness techniques to reconnect with
                    ourselves
                    and the present moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All events are free and local, held online or in Malahide.

                    Come and join us for one of our popular events - all you need is a pen and a notebook, no
                    writing or
                    mindfulness experience is necessary!
